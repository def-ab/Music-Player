The HTML layout defines the element structure that would be shown on the page. The player can be divided into the following portions:
 

Details Portion: This section shows the details of the current track being played. It includes the track number, track album, track name and track artist.
Buttons Portion: This section shows the buttons that are used to control the playback of the track. It includes the play/pause button, the previous and next track buttons. They would have an onclick() method that calls a specific function defined in the JavaScript file.
Sliders Portion: This section contains the seek slider and volume slider that can be used to control the playback and volume.

Using CSS we can style the different portions to make it more visually appealing: 
 

The flex layout is used to arrange the various elements of the player and align them to the middle of the page.
The track art image is given a fixed dimension and made rounded using the border-radius property.
The two sliders have been modified from their default look by using the appearance property. The height and background are changed to suit the color scheme. They are also given slight transparency that smoothly transitions to the full opacity using the transition property.
All the playback controls have their cursor property set so that it changes to a pointer whenever the mouse hovers over it.

The logic of the player is defined in the JavaScript file. There are several functions that work together to handle all the functions of the player.
